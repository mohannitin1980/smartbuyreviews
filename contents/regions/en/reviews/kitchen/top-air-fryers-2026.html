          <h3>Capacity</h3>
          <p>Consider the size of your household and how much food you typically cook. Smaller capacities (around 2-3L) are suitable for individuals or couples, while larger capacities (4L and above) are better for families.</p>

          <h3>Ease of Cleaning</h3>
          <p>Check if the parts are dishwasher-safe or have non-stick coatings to make cleaning easier. Some models come with removable baskets and trays for easy maintenance.</p>

          <h3>Price</h3>
          <p>Set a budget and look for an air fryer that offers the best value for money. Remember that higher-priced models may offer more features and better durability.</p>

          <h3>Brand and Reviews</h3>
