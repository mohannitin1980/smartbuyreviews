    <h2>Buying Guide</h2>
    <p>Choosing the right air fryer can be a daunting task, but with the following considerations, you can make an informed decision:</p>
    
    <h3>Capacity</h3>
    <p>Consider the size of your household and how much food you typically cook. Smaller capacities (around 2-3L) are suitable for individuals or couples, while larger capacities (4L and above) are better for families.</p>
    
    <h3>Features</h3>
    <p>Look for features that suit your cooking needs. Preset programs, adjustable temperature controls, and timers can make cooking more convenient. Some air fryers also offer additional functions like roasting, baking, and dehydrating.</p>
    
    <h3>Size and Design</h3>
    <p>Ensure the air fryer fits comfortably on your countertop and in your storage space. Consider the design and aesthetics if you plan to keep it on display.</p>
    
    <h3>Ease of Cleaning</h3>
    <p>Check if the parts are dishwasher-safe or have non-stick coatings to make cleaning easier. Some models come with removable baskets and trays for easy maintenance.</p>
    
    <h3>Price</h3>
    <p>Set a budget and look for an air fryer that offers the best value for money. Remember that higher-priced models may offer more features and better durability.</p>
    
    <h3>Brand and Reviews</h3>
    <p>Research brands known for quality and reliability. Reading user reviews can provide insights into the performance and longevity of the air fryer.</p>
