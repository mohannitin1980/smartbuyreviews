  <div class="flex flex-col md:flex-row">
    <div class="md:w-1/2 md:pr-4">
      <p class="text-lg">The JOOP! Homme Eau de Toilette is a captivating blend of woody and sweet notes that create a versatile fragrance suitable for any occasion. The opening burst of orange blossom is both refreshing and invigorating, setting the stage for the deeper, more complex notes that follow. Tonka bean accord adds a warm, slightly sweet undertone, while the honey note brings a rich, smooth finish that lingers on the skin.</p>
      <p class="text-lg mt-4">One of the standout features of JOOP! Homme is its medium longevity. This means you can apply it in the morning and still catch whiffs of it throughout your day, making it an excellent choice for those who lead busy lives and don't want to constantly reapply their scent. The fragrance is housed in a sleek, stylish bottle that looks great on any dresser or bathroom shelf, adding a touch of sophistication to your daily routine.</p>

  <h2 class="text-2xl font-bold mb-4">Verdict</h2>
  <p class="text-lg">As I spent more time with JOOP! Homme, I found myself drawn to its complexity and versatility. The initial burst of orange blossom was a delightful surprise each time I wore it, and the tonka bean accord added a depth that kept the fragrance interesting throughout the day. The honey note, while perhaps a bit sweet for some, gave it a unique twist that set it apart from other woody fragrances.</p>
  <p class="text-lg mt-4">The medium longevity was a significant plus for me. I could apply it in the morning and still catch hints of it well into the evening, which is perfect for someone like me who's always on the go. The stylish bottle also added a touch of class to my collection, making it a pleasure to use every day.</p>
  <p class="text-lg mt-4">While the sweetness of the honey note might not appeal to everyone, especially those who prefer more traditional woody scents, I found it to be a refreshing change. The projection, while not as strong as some might like, was still sufficient for my needs. At £28, JOOP! Homme offers fantastic value for money, making it an excellent addition to any fragrance collection.</p>
  <p class="text-lg mt-4">In conclusion, if you're looking for a versatile, long-lasting fragrance that adds a touch of sophistication to your daily routine, JOOP! Homme Eau de Toilette is definitely worth considering. Its unique blend of notes and affordable price make it a standout choice in the world of men's fragrances.</p>
